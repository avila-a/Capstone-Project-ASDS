## MY 498 - Capstone Project - 11/11



### Secondary sources of data

* Entirely accepted and often preferred.

Pro:

1. Often the only possibility (government or twitter).

Cons:

1. Lack of control. May not be exactly that you want
   1. Use nearest equivalent (it's a compromise)
   2. Fill-up the missing observation
   3. Need **access** and **understand**.

#### Types of secondary data

* Social Science microdata

* Aggregated data

* Historical data

  Sources: Data Librarian, **UKDS**, UKDA, UCPSR, (versions for each country) Dataverse, authors webpage, non-public data. 

  

  Email the author! (positive and not trearening, if you are kind and generous, I can work on a variety of resources, make clear the cope of capstone project)

  - protect data in your own archive. Is it embargoed.
  - Should I explain the objective of my project?

Examples:

* Social info surveys, panel and cross-sectional repeated studies (PWP 2)
* Social media
* Business data
* Administrative data
* 358 / BuzzfeedNews

Get the **Documentation** of the data.

Web Scraping. Is primary data and should be "well done"

* Make in clear
* Make it possibly reproducible
* Complete screenshot of webpage



### Software and coding:

Free to do anything but has to bee replicable.

* Note the version of software used for replication
* Transparent explained techniques
* Writing a package is NOT that dificult. But you shoud do a release on GitHub. Is a great thing to do!.



### Good coding practices:

* Segment code: Data creation, Data analysis, Data visualization.

* Prepare readme file with GitHub (public with advisor)

* Sanity checks: outliers, missing values, min/max...

* Comments

* Clear code
