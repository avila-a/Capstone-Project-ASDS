# Talk: Cities - Smart or sinister

### People talking

**Eva Blum** -  Researcher at Privacy International (on defending a word where data is used for the commons)

- Cities is where democracy happens. And it gets messy. They want to change this messiness and that is scary. (example of Paris)
- IBM are the ones who had coined the term of "Smart City". Changes have been driven by companies projects offered to governments. 

**Silvie Delacroix**: Impact of survailance on civir rights @silvieDelacroix

- Smart cities comes from the desire to optimize: and the key ingredient is data. To collect the data you have to put censors, to collect granular data.
- The problem is the one if consent. The idea does not apply here.
- Cities is an example to go from individual to group consent
  - We have to introduce a trust/trustee (trustLaw) to centralize the consent. 
  - Syworks lab experiment. 

**Malcom Smith**:

- reveal the invisibles parameters
- Disconnected: is there a desire to be disconnected from the grid?
  - It is only when disconected that new ideas flurish
- The idea of more data/ability to process it/ is going to solve it? Not! The importance is in the power structure that uses that data.
- the **smart** city: What happens with human interaction when everything works perfectly?

**Christoph**: 

- we live in the era of acceleration
- We live on a new era of techo-fetichism (we hope technology that it solves everything in our behalf). We have gave them important tasks.

### Notes:

- Digitalization and efficience/optimization might be crutial fot tackling the climate crisis
- Part of being a human is imperfections, if we automize eferything we lose the humanity (learn to be different/imperfect)
- The first smart city of IBM in "smart city challenge" was in the south.
- Subductive exercise of power. We are not being 
- Data governance choices will rule the future.
- Data working group working in Data Trust in England.
- Our data is our identity and history.
- We are in a very transactional space regarding to data. And then the trust is lost, we lose all benefits.
- the effect of a new thecnology in a population. The variation comes from the poroprtion of old population.
- Psycological connection to data. Are our desires or own?
- We are works in process and data processes predict our future and changes it. It makes us who they predict and not who we were intended to be?

## Questions

Anonymous data is one of the main dimensions in where people start to be uncomfortable in being tracked. How can a Trust system work if we can't track

There will be some events in the barbican
