- [ ] To do



#### 1st project plan: Provisional statement of intent

_This is a framework to give direction to choice of reading, Anchor reading in a broader context, Consider the pros and cons of different research questions, methodologies, and data sources..._ This is modified and developed

- Organisation of time

- Working title
- Key words – 2 on concepts, 2 on methods, 1 on field
- Abstract: what is the relevant literature? What is your ‘angle’ or ‘perspective’ and how does this ‘add value’? (100 words)
- Research question(s) and/or research aims
- Methodology: what is the research design? What data analytic methods will you use?
- Data sources
- Contingency plan
- Time schedule for completing project milestones
- Preferred supervisor – list 3 Methodology staff, ranked, and list who else the project has been discussed with to date (will be assigned late Jan/early Feb 2020)

Attach completed LSE Research Ethics Review



#### Supervision

- Something like 3 times per term (LT/ST)
- They can review the project **with good notice** (at least 2-3 days)
- Have some data analysis before supervision ends



#### 

#### **Project presentation seminar**: 

When? Early May 2020 (Col 8.13, over two days - dates TBC)

- Short (5-10 minute; 3 slides max.) presentation to staff and fellow students;
- Cover: research questions; constituent concepts; proposed design and methodology; data sources.
- Opportunity to receive comments and feedback
- Presentations are **compulsory**.

**After presentation**:

- Reflect on presentation feedback and how you plan to accommodate this. 
- Revise and finalize project plan to reflect discussion and changes to project: substance, scope and schedule
- Revise and flesh-out proposed timetable for research
- Schedule a progress and strategic planning meeting with supervisor (early June 2020)
- Use updated plan and timetable as basis for discussion with supervisor
- Discuss progress on design and project structure, but also data collection and analysis
