### Download

_TO DO:_

* Review the temporal and geographical reach of each variable of interest for the analysis.
* Look if lower definitions could help fill up some gaps in a NUTS 3 definition grid.


```{r}
# http://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/articles/eurostat_tutorial.html
search <- search_eurostat("NUTS 3")
# ?search_eurostat
# search <- rbind(search, search_eurostat("Investment"))
search
```

Investment: 
- Gross fixed capital formation by NUTS 2 regions nama_10r_2gfcf
 
```{r}
# down_eurostat("edat_lfse_12") -> data_experiment
# data_experiment %>% summary()
```

<!--NOTE: 
- Crimes recorded by the police by NUTS 3 regions 
- Income of households by NUTS 2 regions 
- Employment in technology and knowledge-intensive sectors by NUTS 2 regions and sex (1994-2008, NACE Rev. 1.1)	
- Employment in technology and knowledge-intensive sectors by NUTS 2 regions and sex (from 2008 onwards, NACE Rev. 2)	
- Number of local units, persons employed and wages and salaries by NUTS 2 regions	
- Causes of death - crude death rate by NUTS 2 region of residence
- Income of households by NUTS 2 regions
- Unemployment by sex, age, country of birth and NUTS 2 regions

```{r}
filter_nuts <- function(data, nuts) {
  result <- data %>%
    mutate(geo_char = as.character(geo)) %>%
    filter(nchar(geo_char) == nuts + 2) %>%
    select(-geo_char)
  return(result)
}

eurostat_geodata_60_2016 %>% head

# Get the total number of regions per conutry and level of NUTS:

### Create formulas for analysis and understand the data's limitations:

```{r}
# An example dataset:
gdp_example <- get_eurostat("nama_10r_3gdp",
  time_format = "num")

# Filter all other indicators such as "milion units of national currenct or EU %.
gdp_example <- gdp_example %>%
  filter((unit %in% c("MIO_EUR", "EUR_HAB", "MIO_PPS")))

# Calculate the number of regions included in the database per ...
count_gdp <- gdp_example %>%
  mutate(geo_char = as.character(geo)) %>%
  mutate(LEVL_CODE = case_when(
    nchar(geo_char) == 3 + 2 ~ 3,

    nchar(geo_char) == 1 + 2 ~ 1,
    nchar(geo_char) == 0 + 2 ~ 0,
  ),
  CNTR_CODE = substr(geo_char, 1, 2)) %>% # Get the country code
  filter(substr(geo_char, 3, 3) != "Z") %>% # Avoid the "Extra regions"
  select(-geo_char) %>%

            tot_nuts = max(tot_nuts)
            ) %>%
  arrange(desc(tot_nuts))


# count_gdp %>%

      n_obs = n()
    ) %>%
    arrange(time_min, desc(n_obs))
}

# Function that saves, filters for NUTS 3, and analyses the Eurostat database
down_eurostat <- function(eurostat_str){
  name_df <- get_eurostat(eurostat_str,
                           time_format = "num")

}

# list_euro_data <- c("nama_10r_3gdp", "nama_10r_3gva")
```


Note: 

* It would be good to review the reason of the 7-10 deviations we see on the graph.

* data has some "extra regions NUTS X{1,2,3}" in some countries and one for NUTS level. I am not sure what do they count but have as third, fourth and 5th letter a Z instead of a number.

* All NUTS regions of the same country start the same year, but some "NUTS 2 or 1" have data from 2017 while other NUTS3 have only until 2016

* France and Poland are the biggest "holes" in the data.

Get the GDP

```{r}
# Gross domestic product (GDP) at current market prices by NUTS 3 regions
down_eurostat("nama_10r_3gdp") -> e_gdp
e_gdp <- e_gdp %>%
  filter((unit %in% c("MIO_EUR", "EUR_HAB", "MIO_PPS")))


# Filter all other indicators such as "milion units of national currenct or EU %.
e_gdp$unit %>% table()
e_gdp %>% filter(unit == "EUR_HAB", geo == "FR101")
# Note: We have only data until 2016 for france!
e_gdp %>% head()

# write.csv(gdp, file = "eurostat_gdp.csv")

# Gross value added at basic prices by NUTS 3 regions
down_eurostat("nama_10r_3gva") -> e_gva
e_gva <- e_gva %>%
  filter(currency == "MIO_EUR")

# Note: We have only data until 2016 for france!
e_gva %>% filter(nace_r2 == "J", geo == "FR101")

write.csv(e_gva, file = "data/eurostat_gva.csv")
```


Dechelepètre deflates gdp using country-level Eurostat GDP deflator 

> Regional accounts according to ESA2010 is available as from the reference year 2000 with a few exceptions. Countries that were affected by changes in the NUTS 2016 classification are only legally obliged to provide data in NUTS 2016 for the most recent year, historical series can be reported until December 2019. This particularly affects *Poland, France and Lithuania*. Historical series for the Netherlands are also missing due to a benchmark revision to their National Accounts.

Note: I need to find the old data. France nuts 3 has NOT changed, Poland has changed and Lithuania (i don't know)


Get Employment

```{r}
# Employment (thousand persons) by NUTS 3 regions
down_eurostat("nama_10r_3empers") -> e_emp

# emp <- filter_nuts(employment, 3)
e_emp$geo %>% unique() %>% length()

# # Change values for NACE activities
# e_emp <- e_emp %>%
#   mutate(nace = revalue(nace_r2,
#     c("A" = "Agriculture, forestry and fishing",
#       "B-E" = "Industry (except construction)",
#       "C" = "Manufacturing",
#       "F" = "Construction",
#       "G-J" = "Wholesale and retail trade; transport; accommodation and food service activities; information and communication",
#       "G-I" = "Wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food service activities",
#       "J" = "Information and communication",
#       "K-N" = "Financial and insurance activities; real estate activities; professional, scientific and technical activities; administrative and support service a...",
#       "K" = "Real estate activities",
#       "M_N" = "Professional, scientific and technical activities; administrative and support service activities",
#       "O-U" = "Public administration and defence; compulsory social security; education; human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreati...",
#       "O-Q" = "Public administration, defence, education, human health and social work activities",
#       "R-U" = "Arts, entertainment and recreation; other service activities; activities of household and extra-territorial organizations and bodies")))

# e_emp <- e_emp %>%
#   mutate(
#     wstatus = revalue(
#       wstatus, 
#       c("EMP" = "Employed persons", # Person 15y+ (or 16y+ in Iceland and Norway) who during the reference week performed +1h of work for pay, profit or family gain.
#         "SAL" = "Employees"))) # Person with contract to work for employer and receives compensation

head(e_emp)
summary(e_emp)
colSums(is.na(e_emp))

write.csv(e_emp, file = "data/eurostat_employment.csv")

## Also data of labor market by city (with missing data) (see also "urb_clma")
# https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_llma&lang=en
```

* Look at unemployment statistscs (and others) of "cities" as here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/RCI/#?vis=city.statistics&lang=en
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/cities/data/database
* I would like to know the geografical definition of the city that builds these statistics. Is it the LAU definition? The functional urban areas?

## GDP, GVA and employment for France, Poland, and others who did not had it:

```{r}
# Test that we have low observations for france and poland
e_gdp %>%
  mutate(CNTR_CODE = substr(geo, 1, 2) %>% as.factor()) %>%
  select(CNTR_CODE) %>% table()

e_gva %>%
  mutate(CNTR_CODE = substr(geo, 1, 2) %>% as.factor()) %>%
  select(CNTR_CODE) %>% table()

e_emp %>%
  mutate(CNTR_CODE = substr(geo, 1, 2) %>% as.factor()) %>%
  select(CNTR_CODE) %>% table()
```

1. Get the old data:

```{r}
# Get them:

old_gdp <- read_delim("data/refin.nama_10r_3gdp.dat",
                      "\t", 
                      trim_ws = TRUE,
                      col_types = cols(obs_decimals = col_skip(), 
                                       obs_status = col_skip())) 

old_gva <- read_delim("data/refin.nama_10r_3gva.dat",
                      "\t", 
                      trim_ws = TRUE, # trim whitespace
                      col_types = cols(obs_decimals = col_skip(), 
                                       obs_status = col_skip()))

old_emp <- read_delim("data/refin.nama_10r_3empers.dat",
                      "\t", 
                      trim_ws = TRUE, # trim whitespace
                      col_types = cols(obs_decimals = col_skip(), 
                                       obs_status = col_skip()))

old_emp %>% head()
old_emp$wstatus %>% table
```

2. filter and review it is complete:

```{r}

  filter(currency == "MIO_EUR")  %>% # Delete MIO_NAC entries
  select(-currency) 

old_emp <- old_emp %>%
  mutate(CNTR_CODE = substr(geo, 1, 2) %>% as.factor()) %>%
  #filter_nuts(3) %>%
  select(-unit)

# Review we have the data:

```

Tests and ideas on how the changes in NUTS 3 regions affect the statistics of GDP:

```{r}
# EXAMPLE BOUNDARY SHIFT: ¿IS a good idea to include also territories that have "small" bounday shifts?

# I have to decide if I exclude from the dataset the NUTS that have had bounday shifts but that Eurostat has a continuous series for them. I don't know if they ar OK or not.
# -->  Look if they have the same data (Look at Belfast, that has a boundary change)):

old_gdp %>% filter(geo == "UKN01", # Old belfast
                   unit == "MIO_EUR") %>%
  select(unit, geo, time, obs_value) %>%
  left_join(y = e_gdp %>% filter(geo == "UKN06", # New belfast
                   unit == "MIO_EUR"), by = "time")

# Note: There are BIG disparities between both statistics even if the territory of the NUTS 3 increases just a bit. 
# Conclusion: I would not include it if there was no previous data. Given is Eurostat who is "creating" the previous data I feel confident about it.

# EXAMPLE SIMPLE REDIFINITION OF NAME:
# Look if France 2015 in old data is the same as 2015 in new data:

old_gdp %>% filter(geo == "FR711", # Old Ain
                   unit == "MIO_EUR") %>%
  select(unit, geo, time, obs_value) %>%
  full_join(y = e_gdp %>% filter(geo == "FRK21", # New Ain (France)
                   unit == "MIO_EUR"), by = "time")

# Note: Values for 2015 are between a 3-5% change (a 3-5% increase in GDP that is not justified!) and I only get 1 year more of data. Does the same happens with Paris?

old_gdp %>% filter(geo == "FR101", # Old Paris
                   unit == "MIO_EUR") %>%
  select(unit, geo, time, obs_value) %>%
  full_join(y = e_gdp %>% filter(geo == "FR101", # New Paris (France)
                   unit == "MIO_EUR"), by = "time")

# The `unjustified` growth of Paris is of a 0.15%
100*(212410.4-212091)/212091

# Differences all arround (for MIO_EUR)
old_gdp %>% filter(unit == "MIO_EUR") %>%
  select(unit, geo, time, obs_value) %>%
  full_join(y = e_gdp %>% filter(unit == "MIO_EUR"), by = c("geo", "time")) %>%
  mutate(increase = 100*(values-obs_value)/obs_value) -> test_change

mean(test_change$increase, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(test_change$increase, breaks = 50, xlim = c(-10, 10))
# Note: there are some very big changes, should I discard them from the data?
```

Notes:

* New variabels to include: 
  + Urban area/rural area in NUTS 3 (multiple ways to define)
  + % of urban area covered by LEZ zone (same, with real shp files or with bounding boxes/elipsis)
  + Transportation statistics, is this city a transportation hub? Do extra-radial roads exist?
  + Look data for NUTS 2 too, especially the medical and others https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/regions/data/database
